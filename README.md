# Real-Time Sign Gesture Detection with TensorFlow Object Detection

A practical implementation of sign language estimation using an LSTM NN built on TF Keras.

## Key Features
- **Image Collection:** Utilize your webcam and OpenCV to gather images for deep learning.
- **Image Labeling:** Use LabelImg to label images for sign language detection.
- **TensorFlow Object Detection Pipeline Setup:** Configure the pipeline for TensorFlow Object Detection.
- **Transfer Learning:** Train a deep learning model using transfer learning techniques.
- **Real-Time Sign Language Detection:** Detect sign language gestures in real time using OpenCV.
