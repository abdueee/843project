Real-Time Sign Gesture Detection with TensorFlow Object Detection
Speech-to-text and translators have significantly enhanced accessibility, but what about those who cannot speak or hear?

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to leveraging TensorFlow Object Detection and Python to bridge that communication gap. The accompanying video tutorial demonstrates how to build an end-to-end custom object detection model, enabling real-time translation of sign language.

Key Features
Image Collection: Utilize your webcam and OpenCV to gather images for deep learning.
Image Labeling: Use LabelImg to label images for sign language detection.
TensorFlow Object Detection Pipeline Setup: Configure the pipeline for TensorFlow Object Detection.
Transfer Learning: Train a deep learning model using transfer learning techniques.
Real-Time Sign Language Detection: Detect sign language gestures in real time using OpenCV.
