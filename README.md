# Real-Time Sign Gesture Detection with TensorFlow Object Detection

Speech-to-text and translators have significantly enhanced accessibility, but what about those who cannot speak or hear?

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to leveraging TensorFlow Object Detection and Python to bridge that communication gap. The accompanying video tutorial demonstrates how to build an end-to-end custom object detection model, enabling real-time translation of sign language.

## Key Features
- **Image Collection:** Utilize your webcam and OpenCV to gather images for deep learning.
- **Image Labeling:** Use LabelImg to label images for sign language detection.
- **TensorFlow Object Detection Pipeline Setup:** Configure the pipeline for TensorFlow Object Detection.
- **Transfer Learning:** Train a deep learning model using transfer learning techniques.
- **Real-Time Sign Language Detection:** Detect sign language gestures in real time using OpenCV.

## Getting Started
1. **Dependencies:** Ensure you have the tensorflow and opencv libraries and frameworks installed.
2. **Pipeline Configuration:** Set up the TensorFlow Object Detection pipeline first.
3. **Model Training:** Train the deep learning model using transfer learning methods.
4. **Real-Time Detection:** Implement real-time sign language detection using OpenCV.
